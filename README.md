# Two-Seven-Ten-Web
Repository for my rendition of the card game Two-Seven-Ten as a website
The project will use React and allow the player to play the card game Two-Seven-Ten against 3 AI players

The game can be found at this link: https://carterjbuell.github.io/Two-Seven-Ten-Web/

A feedback form to suggest ideas and report bugs can be found here: https://forms.gle/uazdsngrVkgnTDAB8

This game is under continuous development and things such as better support for varying screen sizes are on their way!!!
